# Sensitivity Analyses

MMRM is an appropriate choice for the primary analysis in many longitudinal clinical trials under the MAR assumption.
Flexibility in modeling treatment effects over time and the within-patient error correlation structure makes MMRM a widely useful analysis.
Consider sensivitiy analyses to check model assumptions e.g. MNAR methods
LOCF, complete case: used in the past

Mit Alexandra abstimmen: was genau, machst du MI in deinem Teil, MMRM vs. MI+ANCOVA?, was ist eure primary analysis + typische sensitivity analyses
MI: eingehen auf welche Variablen im Modell e.g. at least those from the primary model

## Missing covariates
- missing baseline value of the outcome: MI or use of mean imputation (Paper: ),

## Multiple imputation

## Handling nonignorable missingness (MNAR)
- Assumption of MAR is often reasonable, but possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out.
- Thus, analysis under MNAR needed
- Analysis under MNAR: these methods are heavily assumption driven and the assumptions are not testable as we do not have the missing data
- Consider a sensitivity analsyis framework allowing assessment of robustness of results to the various assumptions
- MNAR methods: Pattern-mixture, delta method
