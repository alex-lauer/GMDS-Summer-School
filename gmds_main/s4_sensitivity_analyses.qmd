# Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses with respect to missing data - only?

- MMRM is an appropriate choice for the primary analysis in many longitudinal clinical trials under the MAR assumption.
- MCAR and MAR missingness can be ignored in likelihood-based analyses. MAR: future outcomes for subjects who discontinued should be similar to the future outocmes of subjects who continued if they had the same values of past (observed) outcomes, covariates,...
- Flexibility in modeling treatment effects over time and the within-patient error correlation structure makes MMRM a widely useful analysis.
- Consider sensivitiy analyses to check model assumptions e.g. MNAR methods
- Comparing results from sensitivity analyses: how much inference rely on the assumptions
- Here, inference with regard to the treatment effect. Thus, investigate how treatment effects vary depending on assumptions e.g. about missing data.
- Uncertainty from incompleteness cannot be objectively evaluated from observed data so there is a need for missing data sensitivity analyses.

Mit Alexandra abstimmen: was genau, machst du MI in deinem Teil, MMRM vs. MI+ANCOVA?, was ist eure primary analysis + typische sensitivity analyses
MI: eingehen auf welche Variablen im Modell e.g. at least those from the primary model

## Simple approaches
In general, not recommended for use. Methods are of histroic interest and provide a useful starting point
- LOCF: used in the past, justified as it was thought that it provides conservative estimates
- complete case (observed case/completers analysis): creates selection bias, may cause overestimation of within group effects particularly at the last scheduled visit

## Missing covariates (baseline data)
- missing baseline value of the outcome: MI or use of mean imputation (Paper: ), 
- MMRM not efficient or potential biased estimates as subjects with missing covariates are excluded from the analysis

## Baseline complete, missingness in post-baseline values
- for MMRM: at least one post-baseline value needed
- when implemented in similar manners: MI and MMRM have similar assumptions and yield similar results. Thus, MI implemented similarly to MMRM is not a sensitivity analysis

## Multiple imputation
- MI very useful for sensitivity analyses

## Handling nonignorable missingness (MNAR)
- Assumption of MAR is often reasonable, but possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out.
- Thus, analysis under MNAR needed
- Analysis under MNAR: these methods are heavily assumption driven and the assumptions are not testable as we do not have the missing data
- Consider a sensitivity analsyis framework allowing assessment of robustness of results to the various assumptions
- MNAR methods: Pattern-mixture, delta-adjustment method (controlled imputation; another method is reference-based imputation)
