    "text": "1.2 Longitudinal Data\nThis workshop focuses on the analysis of data observed in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Here, patients have assessments taken at the start of their treatment and then subsequently throughout the course of the trial based on a pre-specified schedule of assessments. The measurement at the start of the treatment is usually referred to as the baseline.\nResearchers can be interested in\n\nthe occurrence of a certain event during the course of the trial, e.g. death or a cardiac event, or the time to the occurrence of such an event, or\nthe longitudinal profile from multiple repeated measurements taken, with a focus on either estimates at a landmark visit or across several time points.\n\nThe outcomes under point 1. can be handled via a comparison of the percentages of patients with events between treatment arms, or a time-to-event analysis. Both are out of scope of this workshop."
