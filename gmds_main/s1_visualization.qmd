# Longitudinal Data Exploration and Visualization

- Data on individuals followed over time with information collected at several time points
- Clusters are the individuals who are followed over time
- Repeated observations are taken at regular times (balanced, fixed occasions, do not differ between subjects) 
- Change from baseline or acutal value at a specific timepoint

Datasets used in this course:
- all2 Data on ...
- drop2 Data on ...
- 

## Dataset all2
- Are the data balanced and equally spaced?
- Number of observations
- Plot trajectories, different colors for each treatment group (or panels), add mean to your plot
- Generate and interpret the group-wise boxplots of the change
- Plot trajectories separaetly by gender. Comment on the plots

## Correlation structure, covariance matrices
Regular observation times, structured correlation matrix
- Variance components (VC) independence structure
- Compound symmetry (CS) also known as exchangeable
- Toeplitz (TOEP)
- First order auto regressive (AR(1))
- Unstructured (UN)

UN is the most flexible. Choose a reasonable covaraiance structure which is the best compromise between model fit and complexity. E.g. use AIC as it penalises more complex models.

Compute the empirical correlations between measurement timepoints. Looking at these correlations, comment on the suitability of the correlation structures VC, CS, UN.
